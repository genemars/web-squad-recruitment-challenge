# Web Squad Recruitment Challenge

**Working Time:** 8 h
**Technologies:** Bootstrap grid, Scss, HTML, jQuery, bourbon
**Requirements:** Mobile first, Animations

## Description:
Show us what you can build in about 8 hours. We have sent you designs for a responsive website and now it is your turn to build it. The listed technologies above, are the ones we usually use to develop our websites. Use them if you want to show us that you are confident with using them. Otherwise you are totally free in using other technologies and giving the page another twist. Just keep in mind why you choose to do something different. 
Please implement the page mobile first, so that it looks beautiful on any screen and window sizes. If you want to earn some extra kudos give the page some awesome animations, easter eggs, interactions or anything you can think of. 
**Another hint:** It’s not important that everything is completed. So for example if you have a great idea how to animate the mockups or implement something extra nice, then it’s ok to just leave the navigation as a placeholder. We don’t want you to put too many hours in this challenge. We only want to get an idea of how you like to build websites. Have fun!
